My name is **Guangyan Cai** (蔡广彦), and I am a research engineer at [SceniX](https://scenix.ai/), where I develop simulation engines for robotic learning systems.

I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of California, Irvine, School of Information and Computer Sciences, under the supervision of [Prof. Shuang Zhao](https://shuangz.com/). My doctoral research focused on physics-based differentiable rendering and its applications, including inverse rendering.

Previously, I received my B.S. in Computer Science from the University of California, San Diego, where I worked with [Prof. Ravi Ramamoorthi](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu//~ravir/).
