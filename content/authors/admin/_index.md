G﻿uangyan Cai is a third-year Ph.D. Student in Computer Science at UC Irvine School of Information and Computer Science, advised by [Prof. Shuang Zhao](https://shuangz.com/). I am interested in physics-based differentiable rendering and its applications, such as inverse rendering. 

I received my B.S. degree in Computer Science from UC San Diego, where I worked with [Prof. Ravi Ramamoorthi](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu//~ravir/).
