abstract: Reconstructing the shape and spatially varying surface appearances of
  a physical-world object as well as its surrounding illumination based on 2D
  images (e.g., photographs) of the object has been a long-standing problem in
  computer vision and graphics. In this paper, we introduce a robust object
  reconstruction pipeline combining neural based object reconstruction and
  physics-based inverse rendering (PBIR). Specifically, our pipeline firstly
  leverages a neural stage to produce high-quality but potentially imperfect
  predictions of object shape, reflectance, and illumination. Then, in the later
  stage, initialized by the neural predictions, we perform PBIR to refine the
  initial results and obtain the final high-quality reconstruction. Experimental
  results demonstrate our pipeline significantly outperforms existing
  reconstruction methods quality-wise and performance-wise.
