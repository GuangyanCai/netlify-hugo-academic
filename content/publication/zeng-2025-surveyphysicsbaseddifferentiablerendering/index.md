abstract: 'Physics-based differentiable rendering has emerged as a powerful technique in computer graphics and vision, with a broad range of applications in solving inverse rendering tasks. At its core, differentiable rendering enables the computation of gradients with respect to scene parameters, allowing optimization-based approaches to solve various problems. Over the past few years, significant advancements have been made in both the underlying theory and the practical implementations of differentiable rendering algorithms. In this report, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of the art in physics-based differentiable rendering, focusing on recent advances in general differentiable rendering theory, Monte Carlo sampling strategy, and computational efficiency.'
